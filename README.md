# Folder Locker

This is a simple folder locker script for Windows operating systems. The script creates a folder named "secured" and allows the user to lock and unlock the folder.

## How to use

1. Save the script as a `.bat` file on your Windows computer
2. Run the script in the Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell
3. Choose whether to lock or unlock the folder by typing "Y" or "N" when prompted
4. If you choose to unlock the folder, you will be prompted to enter a password. The password is set as "123456".
5. If the password is entered correctly, the folder will be unlocked. If the password is incorrect, you will be prompted to enter it again.

Note: The script uses basic security measures, but it is not meant to be used as a secure method of protecting your files. It is recommended to use proper encryption and backup methods for sensitive data.
